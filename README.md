Euro2020DeFi is an application that predicts the results of football matches of the Euro 2020 final round,
where players can predict the winning or losing result of each match to receive a reward of EUR16 tokens.

3. How to participate in the prediction and win the reward EUR16
-- Each match will be a pool that allows users to bet NFT cards representing the 2 teams of that match.
The results will be calculated as follows:
# The reward value will be loaded into the pool, players can bet on their favorite team or they predict to win.
All of these things need to be completed 1 hour before the match to ensure fairness.
# After the match is over, the player who owns the NFT card of the winning team in the match they participated
in will get that NFT card back along with the corresponding number of rewards divided equally among all players wins,
all NFT cards of the losing team will be destroyed.
# Each player can participate with an unlimited number of NFT cards.
-- Convert NFT tokens from EUR16 tokens and vice versa:
# Each team will claim a certain amount of EUR16 tokens depending on the value of that team on the transfer market.
# To own the NFT card of your favorite team, you need to buy enough EUR16 tokens and exchange them for NFT cards in the market.
And vice versa, you can also change from NFT card to the amount of EUR16 tokens corresponding to the value of that card.
# Remember that you will lose your NFT card if you predict the wrong team to win, think carefully before choosing, NFA.
